# Project Setup and Guide

## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate a full **Python-based data pipeline** with:  

- Modular project structure using `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` for local packages.  
- Virtual environment setup for dependency management.  
- Data ingestion into **MongoDB Atlas**.  
- Logging and exception handling in Python.  
- Notebooks for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering**.  

The project helps you learn how to structure Python projects professionally, work with databases, and apply data science workflows.

## Theory

### 1. Python Project Structure

- `template.py` – Script to create the project template.  
- `setup.py` & `pyproject.toml` – Used to define and install local packages.  
- `requirements.txt` – Stores external Python dependencies.  

> Proper structuring allows reusability and better package management.

### 2. Virtual Environment

Using `conda` or `venv` ensures that dependencies are **isolated** per project.  

**Benefits:**  

- Avoid version conflicts  
- Reproducible environments  
- Easy deployment  

### 3. MongoDB

MongoDB is a **NoSQL database** that stores data in **JSON-like key-value documents**.  

- MongoDB Atlas allows cloud-hosted free-tier databases.  
- Each project should have its **cluster**, **database**, and **collection**.  
- Connection strings allow Python programs to access the database securely.

### 4. Logging and Exception Handling

- **Logging:** Records application behavior. Useful for debugging and monitoring.  
- **Exception Handling:** Catches runtime errors and prevents crashes.  

### 5. EDA and Feature Engineering

- EDA: Understand dataset characteristics, check missing values, visualize distributions.  
- Feature Engineering: Transform raw data into meaningful features for ML or analytics.
